​

HOW SHOULD I STORE COFFEE BEANS?
It's a common misconception that coffee beans or grounds keep better in the freezer or refrigerator. This actually reduces the freshness and can dilute the flavor because the moisture condenses on the coffee itself. The best place for storage is ideally in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature and, if possible, away from sunlight and heat. Learn more about how to keep  your coffee fresh . ​

HOW IS COFFEE DECAFFEINATED?
The decaffeination process begins with green coffee beans after they are harvested. Once picked, there are three primary ways to create decaffeinated coffee: the Direct Contact Method, the SWISS WATER® Process and the Natural Decaffeination Process. In each of these methods, the green coffee beans are soaked in warm water, making the caffeine more easily removeable while preserving the flavor within the bean. From there, the caffeine is extracted or dissolves before the beans are roasted to bring out the aroma, acidity, body and flavor. Learn more about your favorite Starbucks® decaf coffees and the  decaffeination process .
